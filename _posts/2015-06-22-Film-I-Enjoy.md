>Some of us get dipped in flat, some in satin, some in gloss.... But every once in a while you find someone who's iridescent, and when you do, nothing will ever compare.

我多么希望能遇到一个人，告诉她：You are the one nothing will ever compare。

###心灵捕手 Good Will Hunting

Sean与Will在公园里的促膝长谈,Sean讲了下面一段话 
>So, if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on Every art book ever written. 如果我问你艺术,你可能会提出艺术书籍中的粗浅论调。Michelangelo. You know a lot about him: life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation, the whole works, right? 有关米开朗基罗,你知道很多，他的满腔政治热情，与教皇相交莫逆，耽于性爱，你对他很清楚吧？But I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling…seeing that. 但你连西斯汀教堂的气味也不曾嗅到？你未曾站在那儿，昂首眺望天花板上的名画吧？可是我见过。If I ask you about women, you'll probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. 如果我问关于女人的事， 你大可以向我如数家珍，你可能上过几次床，但你没法说出当自己在女人身旁醒来时，那份涌自内心真正的喜悦。You're a tough kid. And I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh, throw Shakespeare at me, right? "Once more onto the breach, dear friends…"你年轻彪悍，我如果和你谈论战争，你会向我大抛莎士比亚， 朗诵“共赴战场，亲爱的朋友”But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap…and watched him gasp his last breath, lookin' to you for help. 但你从未亲临战阵，未试过把挚友的头拥入怀里，看着他吸着最后一口气，凝望着你，垂死向你求助。I ask you about love, you'll probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable……我问你何为爱情，你可能只会吟风弄月，但你未试过全情投入真心倾倒，Known someone that could level you with her eyes……feelin' like God put an angel on earth just for you……who could rescue you from the depths of hell……四目交投时彼此了解对方的心，好比上帝安排天使下凡只献给你，把你从地狱深渊拯救出来And you wouldn't know what it's like to be her angel……to have that love for her, be there forever…through anything…through cancer. 
对她百般关怀的感受你也从未体会，你从未对她情深款款矢志厮守，明知她患了绝症也再所不惜，你从未尝试过痛失挚爱的感受。And you wouldn't know about sleeping sittin' up in a hospital room for two months, holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you. 你也从未经历过在她的病床前坚定不移地陪伴，紧握着她的纤手，因为医生知道你根本就不在乎“探访时间”的明文约束。You don't know about real loss……'cause that only occurs when you love something more than you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. 你并没有体会过“失去”的真正意义...因为只有在你爱某人甚于自身时才会领悟。我怀疑你从未付出过这样的爱。I look at you.I don't see an intelligent, confident man. I see a cocky, scared-shitless kid. 现在我看着你，眼前所见并非一位聪敏、自信的男人，而是一个无耻狂妄、内心恐惧的孩子But you're a genius, Will. No one denies that. No one could possibly understand the depths of you. 但是你是个天才，威尔。这是毋庸置疑的。没人可以完全认识到你的深度。But you presume to know everything about me, because you saw a painting of mine. You ripped my fuckin' life apart. 但是你在我的油画上瞥过一眼、就以为了解了我的一切？你的狂言糟蹋了我的人生！You're an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing about how hard your life has been? How you feel? Who you are? Because I read Oliver Twist? Does that encapsulate you?你是个孤儿吧？但你认为我能看穿你的悲惨生活、认识你的全部，仅仅因为我读过《雾都孤儿》？莫非它能简化你的人生？Personally, I don't give a shit about all that. Because you know what? I can't learn anything from you I can't read in some fuckin' book. 个人而言，我对此莫不关心。因为你知道吗？我无法通过一些破书来认识你的一点一滴。Unless, you wanna talk about you…who you are. Then I 'm fasciated. I'm in. But you don't want to do that, do you? You're terrified of what you might say.除非你先谈论自己，告诉我你到底是谁。于是我对此着迷，我愿意来帮助你。但是你并不想这么做，是吗？你甚至还怕你会被说出来的话吓到。

Sean诚恳地为Will解除心魔
>t's not your fault...这不是你的错...

这部电影经典的对白很多，篇幅原因就只列这两个触动最深的。我们平日的对话通常都是传达信息，甚至打发时间。但是当我们卸下防卫，将对话用于心灵的交流时，我们能够感受到对方的感受，达到一语胜千言的畅快。以前我总觉得自己不善表达，是因为文字功底差。现在我的体会是，只要是发自内心真切的感受，任何表达出来的语句都必将动人。而我恰恰是一个沉浮于世、极少用心去感受的人。我看不见天空，看不见树叶。所以做不到。  

###模仿游戏 The Imitation Game

>-It's about cryptography.   
>-Like secret messages?  
>-Not secret. That's the brilliant part. Messages that anyone can see,but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key.  
>-How's that different from talking?  
>-Talking?  
>-When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean. They say something else,and you're expected to just know what they mean.Only I never do. So, how's that different?  

从广义来说，这整个世界都是加密的，我们听到的，看到的。有的人善于解密，所以他们能通情达理，能洞若明火，甚至能顿悟人生。解密的关键，我觉得就是用心去感受，不懂用心去感受的人，就只能糊涂一世。
